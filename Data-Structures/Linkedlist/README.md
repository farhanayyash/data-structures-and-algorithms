# Class 5

# Linked List
Build a Linked list in JAVA ;

## Challenge
We need to generate a linked list by defining a class for the node and a class for the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
- create a class for the first Node and add a dynamic value for it.
- create a class for the Linked list to link each new Node with the author Nodes.
- Define methods to insert values in the Node and includes method take a value as an argument to find if this value exists in the linked list.
- Display the output as a string in a specific format.
- In the end we created a Test to check our code if running correctly in all cases.
